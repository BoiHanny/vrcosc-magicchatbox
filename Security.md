# 📜 MagicChatbox Terms of Service (TOS)

These Terms of Service govern your use of MagicChatBox. They are intended to ensure a respectful, lawful, and safe environment for all users. They apply when you run or interact with the software and do **not** cover modification or distribution rights—which are addressed in the separate [Software License Agreement](https://github.com/BoiHanny/vrcosc-magicchatbox/edit/master/License.md).

> [!CAUTION]
> ## 1. Data Collection and Monitoring
> - **1.1** MagicChatBox uses data exclusively to monitor compliance with these terms, including VRChat user’s ID.  
> - **1.2** This data is not used for marketing, profiling, or any purpose unrelated to enforcing these terms and is disposed after use.  
> - **1.3** If violations are detected through monitoring (we mostly do this within VRChat), MagicChatBox reserves the right to exclude users.
>
> **Additional Note on Data Collection:**
>
> To moderate user behavior in the game, MagicChatBox identifies users based solely on their VRChat user ID. To protect your privacy and ensure minimal data collection, MagicChatBox does **not** require users to log in or provide additional sensitive personal information.
>
> To ensure a secure, reliable, and fair moderation process, MagicChatBox performs the following limited check:
>
> - MagicChatBox verifies the existence of the folder:
>   ```
>   AppData\LocalLow\VRChat\VRChat\OSC
>   ```
> - The presence of this folder indicates that OSC is enabled, and that MagicChatBox is actively streaming data to the VRChat application, activating the applicability of these Terms of Service.
> - MagicChatBox scans **only the immediate subfolders** within the above directory to retrieve the VRChat user ID, represented by the subfolder name. This VRChat user ID is checked against our API solely for compliance purposes.
> - **No additional scanning or analysis** is performed beyond verifying the existence and name of this subfolder, We don't even look into the content of those folders.
>
> **Note:** The VRChat user ID used for moderation is distinct from your actual VRChat display name, further safeguarding your personal privacy.
>
