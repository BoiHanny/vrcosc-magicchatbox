# Terms of Service / Conditions of Use ![Runtime](https://badgen.net/badge/REGULATIONS/MCB-OSC/black/?icon=zeit)

### Effective Date: 08.03.2025

By using the MagicChatBox software, you agree to these terms of service. These terms are binding and aim to ensure a respectful and safe environment for all users. If you do not agree with these terms, you are not permitted to use the software.

> [!CAUTION]
> ## 1. Data Collection and Monitoring
> - **1.1** MagicChatBox uses data exclusively to monitor compliance with these terms, including VRChat user's ID.
> - **1.2** This data is not used for marketing, profiling, or any purpose unrelated to enforcing these terms and is disposed after use.
> - **1.3** If violations are detected through monitoring, MagicChatBox reserves the right to exclude users.
>
> **Additional Note on Data Collection:**
>
> To moderate user behavior in the game, MagicChatBox identifies users based solely on their VRChat user ID. To protect your privacy and ensure minimal data collection, MagicChatBox does **not** require users to log in or provide additional sensitive personal information.
>
> To ensure a secure, reliable, and fair moderation process, MagicChatBox performs the following limited check:
>
> - MagicChatBox verifies the existence of the folder:
>
>   ```
>   AppData\LocalLow\VRChat\VRChat\OSC
>   ```
>
> - The presence of this folder indicates that OSC is enabled, and that MagicChatBox is actively streaming data to the VRChat application, activating the applicability of these Terms of Service.
>
> - MagicChatBox scans **only the immediate subfolders** within the above directory to retrieve the VRChat user ID, represented by the subfolder name. This VRChat user ID is checked against our API solely for compliance purposes.
>
> - **No additional scanning or analysis** is performed beyond verifying the existence and name of this subfolder.
>
> **Note:** The VRChat user ID used for moderation is distinct from your actual VRChat display name, further safeguarding your personal privacy.
